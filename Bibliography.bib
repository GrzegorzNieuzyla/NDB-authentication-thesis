    abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

    abstract = {The problem of deciding whether a given propositional formula in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable has been widely studied. I t is known that, when restricted to formulas having only two literals per clause, this problem has an efficient (polynomial-time) solution. But the same problem on formulas having three literals per clause is NP-complete, and hence probably does not have any efficient solution.In this paper, we consider an infinite class of satisfiability problems which contains these two particular problems as special cases, and show that every member of this class is either polynomial-time decidable or NP-complete. The infinite collection of new NP-complete problems so obtained may prove very useful in finding other new NP-complete problems. The classification of the polynomial-time decidable cases yields new problems that are complete in polynomial time and in nondeterministic log space.We also consider an analogous class of problems, involving quantified formulas, which has the property that every member is either polynomial time decidable or complete in polynomial space.},
